This website provides links for the R software, general manuals, and other useful material. One major feature of R is that several advanced statistical methods are available as additional packages, also for free.\nR will be used with RStudio, a user friendly interface for R that makes working with R much easier. In the Advanced Survival Analysis Course, additional packages will be used. A list of packages will be given in a separate document."

She mainly works in survival analysis, with a special interest in competing risks and multi-state models, relative survival and methods for missing data. She collaborates with several organizations in the field of haematology.\nHein Putter is full professor at Leiden University Medical Center (Department of Biomedical Data Sciences). His research interests include competing risks and multi-state models, frailty models and dynamic prediction. He is co-author of the book “Dynamic Prediction in Clinical Survival Analysis”, with Hans van Houwelingen.\nMaja Pohar Perme is professor of biostatistics at the University of Ljubljana, where she received all her degrees. She is the head of the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the Medical faculty. She is highly involved in the development of statistics in Slovenia, she is the head of the Applied Statistics programme at the University of Ljubljana. Her research focuses on survival analysis with particular interest in relative survival methodology and the use of pseudo-observations. She is the author of the relsurv package in R.\nSara Baart has worked on the topic of joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data, applying the method in different clinical studies and extending the framework to case-cohort designs. Currently she works as a statistician in het Erasmus MC, providing statistical support for several clinical departments and working on methodological research.\nNan van Geloven is assistant professor at Leiden University Medical Center (Department of Biomedical Data Sciences). Her research focuses on causal analysis of survival data. She works both on trials and on observational data. She has a special interest in defining estimands and in causal prediction, i.e., predicting outcomes under hypothetical interventions conditional on individual characteristics.\nEdouard Bonneville is a biostatistician with research interests in competing risks, prediction models, and methods for dealing with missing data. He obtained his PhD at Leiden University Medical Center (Department of Biomedical Data Sciences), and will be working at LMU Munich (Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology) on metascientific aspects of methodological research."

    "text": "Are you applying survival analysis methods, and do you want to extend your skills? Then register to our Advanced Survival Analysis course to learn state-of-the-art techniques from international experts.\nOur comprehensive course will build on standard tools for survival outcomes: the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival curve, the log-rank test for testing equality of survival curves and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. For many common situations these techniques do not suffice, e.g., when more than one event is considered, when the effects of risk factors or treatments change over time, when patients are clustered in groups or when a patient population is compared to the general population. We offer methods for statistical modeling in these settings. Our course delves deeper into a wide range of more specialized topics: non-proportional hazards and time-dependent covariates, competing risks and multi-state models, joint models, landmarking and dynamic prediction, pseudo-observations, frailty models, relative survival, missing data and informative censoring.\nThere will be a balance between concepts, mathematics, implementation (computer practicals based on the programming language R) and interpretation. The majority of clinical examples discussed come from the collaborative work of the teachers with clinicians. You will gain hands-on experience with real clinical data in computer practicals to master the methods.\nAfter the course you will have the tools to tackle complex time-to-event problems!\nFurther information about the course content can be found here."

The help of the practical assistants was also great!”\n“The in-depth study of the more complex topics in the subject area was very good. In addition to the previously existing self-learning, the topics were given a more stable basis for further ongoing.”\n“The lectures were very pedagogical and all the lecturers were very skilled. Especially how Liesbeth and also Hein answered the questions is quite profound. They could really pinpoint where the reasoning went “wrong” and why this approach or way of thinking works or does not work, but also gave this feedback in a very respectful and fun way.”"

And super convenient to have the R code answers at hand when working on the practicals. The help of the practical assistants was also great!”\n“The in-depth study of the more complex topics in the subject area was very good. In addition to the previously existing self-learning, the topics were given a more stable basis for further ongoing.”\n“The lectures were very pedagogical and all the lecturers were very skilled. Especially how Liesbeth and also Hein answered the questions is quite profound. They could really pinpoint where the reasoning went “wrong” and why this approach or way of thinking works or does not work, but also gave this feedback in a very respectful and fun way.”"
