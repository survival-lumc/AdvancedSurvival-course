Are you applying survival analysis methods, and do you want to extend your skills? Then register to our Advanced Survival Analysis course to learn state-of-the-art techniques from international experts.

Our comprehensive course will build on standard tools for survival outcomes: the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival curve, the log-rank test for testing equality of survival curves and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. For many common situations these techniques do not suffice, e.g., when more than one event is considered, when the effects of risk factors or treatments change over time, when patients are clustered in groups or when a patient population is compared to the general population. We offer methods for statistical modeling in these settings. Our course delves deeper into a wide range of more specialized topics: non-proportional hazards and time-dependent covariates, competing risks and multi-state models, joint models, landmarking and dynamic prediction, pseudo-observations, frailty models, relative survival, missing data and informative censoring.

There will be a balance between concepts, mathematics, implementation (computer practicals based on the [programming language `R`](https://www.r-project.org/)) and interpretation. The majority of clinical examples discussed come from the collaborative work of the teachers with clinicians. You will gain hands-on experience with real clinical data in computer practicals to master the methods.

After the course you will have the tools to tackle complex time-to-event problems!

## Testimonials from those attending in 2024

*"Good pace, good lecturers, and excellent practical materials useful for further study."*

*"Availability and content of course material were great! And super convenient to have the R code answers at hand when working on the practicals. The help of the practical assistants was also great!"*

*"The in-depth study of the more complex topics in the subject area was very good. In addition to the previously existing self-learning, the topics were given a more stable basis for further ongoing."*

*"The lectures were very pedagogical and all the lecturers were very skilled. Especially how Liesbeth and also Hein answered the questions is quite profound. They could really pinpoint where the reasoning went “wrong” and why this approach or way of thinking works or does not work, but also gave this feedback in a very respectful and fun way."*
